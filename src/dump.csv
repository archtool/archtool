The E-Program has to be received by the BRP before a configurable time (the BRP has to deliver his E-Program to TenneT before 14:00, so the retailer has to supply at least some time before 14:00 o’clock).The algorithm that derives the E-Program from the APX settlement is as follows:
Earlier, during Construct APX spot limit orders set of 24 bid curves were archived for every 24 hours. The retrieved set of 24 index prices from the Eurolight Trading Platform are mapped to the 24 bid curves. By applying the hourly index the corresponding set of 24 volumes can be read. The volumes should correspond to the E-program that APX delivers to TenneT. The E-Program is received as a set of 96 PTE’s. Therefore the received volume per hour is divided in four to fill each PTE in the E-Program.

The interface: http://www.tennet.org/xml/balancedeltaprices/balans-delta.xml
In the case that TenneT does not publish a price; price field remains empty, it did so because it did not want to (de)activate any power. In this case TUS should record the price as a NaN value. Usually this means that TenneT only publishes a price for either upward regulation or downward regulation. It is possible, however, that both upward and downward regulation appear in the same minute, then TenneT publishes two prices as indicated by (<min_price> or <max_price>) .
In the case that TenneT produces empty values over an entire row (except for the sequence number) it means that there are internal processing errors at TenneT.

An important task of the administrator is to add or remove new device agents to the cluster. This does not mean any CRM type of functionality. Since the PowerMatcher has no user interface it is required that there is some basic functionality for energy retailers to add device agents to its cluster. The admin can administer the device agent. The reader is referred to the FAN documentation for adding/removal of agents to the cluster.",Must,requirement
